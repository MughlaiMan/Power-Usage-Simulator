To use our power usage simulation program, you need to do some things first. You first need to put your input file which holds all of the appliances and their info,
into the project folder. The file may already be in the project folder. Also, make sure the file can be located as soon as you click into the project folder. It shouldn't be nested inside other folder that are in the project folder.

Then, create an empty txt file named output if there already isn't one, in the same directory as the input file. This will be your output file.

Then you first run the program and type in the total allowed wattage that should not be exceeded. The number must be an integer.

Next, you enter the number of timesteps, which must be an integer as well.

Next, you enter the file name of the file that holds all of the appliance's information. Make sure to include the .txt at the end of what you input.

Then, a menu will pop up and you can do as you wish. You can do things like add an appliance, or read appliances in from another file(which also needs to be located same as the input file from before)
and also needs to have the .txt at the end of the file name that you input.

You can also do more things. But make sure whatever menu option you choose, you input exactly as the menu states. Like a capital S for starting the simulation, and not a small s.
And make sure any other input you may put in is correct. Like inputting timestep as an integer.

The menu will keep popping up until you start the simulation, which then starts the simulation.

Some output after the simulation is done will be printed to the console, and there will be some output to the txt file you named output which you can open and check.

The output on the console and in the file should be easy to understand.

You can run the program again without worrying about having to delete, move, or create any files again. But if you want, you can replace the input file that holds the appliances and their info with a new one if you want to change the appliances that are used in the simulation. You can also (if you want to) replace the txt file that will be used to read in additional appliances with another txt file that has some other appliances. Or if there isn't already a file for reading in additional appliances in the project folder, you can add one in the project folder. But make sure to put it in the right location in the project folder. You can refer back on this readMe to make sure of that.
